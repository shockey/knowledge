## Notes
- Exercise is an effort and consistency-bound activity (as opposed to knowledge or cleverness-bound), which I think is why many "smart" people and engineering-types find it difficult.

## Recommendations
- [**Strong**](https://strong.app), a slick weightlifting-focused workout tracking app for iOS and Apple Watch.
