# Exercise Routine

This is the exercise routine I currently follow. The weightlifting routine has prescribed days â€” I perform cardio on the non-lifting days.

## Cardio

Row the following intervals on an ergometer for time:
- 500 meters
- 500 meters
- 2000 meters
- 2000 meters

After each interval, rest for the shorter of five minutes and as long as the interval took you to perform.

Track pace in each interval as progress indicators.

## Weightlifting

This routine is adapted from the famous [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), as well as [Andy Morgan's bodybuilding routine](https://rippedbody.com/novice-bodybuilding-program/), with some customizations on top to suit my preferences.

Some ground rules:
- Dumbbell movements are measured as the weight of a single dumbbell, regardless of whether the exercise is one or two-handed. 

...and some table notation tips:
- `W` means perform warm-up sets.
