# Exercise Routine

This is the exercise routine I currently follow. The weightlifting routine has prescribed days â€” I perform cardio on the non-lifting days.

## Cardio

Row on an ergometer as fast as possible for a 250 meter interval, then rest for as long as the interval took you to perform.

Start with 3 intervals, then progress by adding more intervals ~weekly. Track pace and total distance as performance indicators.

## Weightlifting

This routine is adapted from the famous [Reddit PPL](https://www.reddit.com/r/Fitness/comments/37ylk5/a_linear_progression_based_ppl_program_for/), as well as [Andy Morgan's bodybuilding routine](https://rippedbody.com/novice-bodybuilding-program/), with some customizations on top to suit my preferences.

Some ground rules:
- Dumbbell movements are measured as the weight of a single dumbbell, regardless of whether the exercise is one or two-handed. 

...and some table notation tips:
- `W` means perform warm-up sets.
