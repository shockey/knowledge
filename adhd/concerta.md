# Concerta

Concerta is an extended-release stimulant medication used to treat ADHD in adults and children. Its active ingredient is methylphenidate.

Personally, I have taken it as a child and adult as-needed to address symptoms of ADHD.

### True generics issues 

Brand-name Concerta features an [osmotic-controlled release oral delivery system (OROS)](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Osmotic-controlled_release_oral_delivery_system) developed in the 80s by Alza Corporation.

In the US market, a Concerta prescription could be filled as **brand** (trademarked Concerta manufactured by Janssen Pharmaceuticals), **authorized generic** (brand product manufactured by Janssen, and distributed by a different company), or **true generic** (one of many different formulations manufactured by someone else, who has submitted evidence to the FDA showing that their product is roughly equivalent to brand-name Concerta). If you don't request anything specific, your insurer will usually arrange for you to receive a generic, since it's cheaper. 

The FDA doesn't require true generics to use the same delivery mechanisms. In practice, this means that many Concerta "true generics" don't use the OROS technology, which opens the door to less stable drug delivery rates and poorer symptom control. 

It's for this reason that I make sure my Concerta prescriptions are filled as brand-only.
