# Personal Goalkeeping

I use two systems for keeping up with my personal goals: **Quarterly OKRs** and **Annual Goal Lists**. I hold myself to the commitments I make in both by making a **Progress Journal** entry every two weeks. 

### Quarterly OKRs

> (that's [Objectives and Key Results](https://www.whatmatters.com/faqs/okrs-objectives-key-results-explanation-examples/), fyi)

At the start of each calendar quarter, I make a document listing things I'd like to focus on for the next 12 weeks in the form of OKRs. Each objective has a title, a "why" statement, and key results I can measure progress against. 

For example:

```md
# OKRs for 2021 Q2

## Themes and meditations
[A statement of intention, what a successful time would look like in retrospect, and any other context future-me could benefit from.]

## Objective A: Write a blog
I've long had aspirations to keep a blog (be it personal, professional, or pseudonymous), and have taken many half-baked stabs at it, but haven't ever gotten anything to stick. Time to change!

Key Results:
1. Set up a [simple](https://critter.blog/2021/01/14/prove-you-can-write-regularly-before-you-think-about-the-tools/) with less than 5 hours of effort
2. Publish a blog post (no matter the length!) every Saturday
3. Avoid tinkering with the blog's code or design until I've written 25 posts

## Other thoughts
Some objectives that didn't make it in, but do seem interesting to me for future consideration:
- Minimize my physical possessions (& donate unwanted items?)
- Become decent at a team sport
```

Once the new quarter starts, I make every effort to treat the document as finalized — in other words, **don't touch it**, because it serves as a historical marker of what you committed yourself to. Progress is tracked in a [Progress Journal](#progress-journals).

### Annual Goal Lists

Each December, I begin putting together an aspirational document for what I'd like the coming year to look like. 

Importantly, this document does not sign me up for any near-term commitments — that's what the quarterly OKRs are for — it's instead meant to be a guide and reference for how I want my time to be spent.

It has a few sections:

* **Pitch**: Sets the overall tone, and demonstrates how everything below it ties together.
* **Habits**: Something I'd like to begin or continue doing repeatedly or on a regular basis. (Can be measurable or mushy.)
* **Quant Goals**: Something to achieve by year-end that can be measured in numbers.
* **Qual Goals**: Something to achieve by year-end that's too mushy to be measured with numbers.
* **TODOs**: Something to do by year-end that can be done in a single day or less.
* **Non-goals**: Something to avoid investing time or energy into this year.

Here's what an actual document might look like (in fact, some of these are real!):

```md
# Annual Goal List for 2021

## Pitch
2021 is about balanced, sustainable progress. 

I want to focus on my health (via better sleep and exercise) and time management (news-avoidance, and reading), while moving forward materially in my career (L6!) and also improving my optionality (recurring revenue!).

## Habits
- Keep a stable sleep schedule
- Exercise 4x/wk

## Quant Goals
- Generate $200 MRR from software projects
- Read 25 books
- Take at least 15 days of PTO

## Qual Goals
- Learn to play poker reasonably well
- Land a level L6 engineering position

## TODOs
- Get another tattoo
- Visit Fallingwater in Mill Run, PA

## Non-Goals
- Spending lots of time reading news, social media, or about current events I can't control
```

In contrast to the OKR documents, I **do** encourage marking up the annual goal list as the year moves along, by checking off items as I achieve them.

## Progress Journals

Journal entries are made every other week (on even-week-of-year Sundays). 

Each entry lists each key result from the current quarter's OKRs, as well as any incomplete item from the year's goal list, providing a status indicator (green, yellow, or red, as an emoji) and brief summary of previous-two-week progress and next-two-week outlook.
