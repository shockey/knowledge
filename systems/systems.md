# Systems

I'm a bit of a nut for systems â€” mostly because I'd never get a single thing done without a way to track it.

## Things I recommend
- [**Notion**](https://notion.so/), a fantastic all-in-one editing tool. I use it to manage non-public documents, such as goal lists and journal entries.
- [**Beeminder**](https://beeminder.com/), a habit enforcement tool that charges your card if you don't log enough progress. I use it to keep my eye on a few critical habits that I'd probably otherwise let slip.
- [**Things.app**](https://culturedcode.com/things/), an opinionated to-do tracker for iOS and macOS. I like it because it feels just enough like _org-mode_ to scratch that itch, without needing much upkeep.
