# Knowledge Wiki

I use this wiki to capture knowledge I'd like to remember. I began maintaining it in March 2021.

This project is [both good and original](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/samuel_johnson_161407), but I've borrowed a lot of structure from [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) â€” be sure to check that out too if you'd like to stand up your own.
