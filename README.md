# My Knowledge Wiki

I aim to use this repository (and [associated GitBook](https://wiki.kyleshockey.com)) to capture things I'd like to remember.

This project is [both good and original](https://www.brainyquote.com/quotes/samuel_johnson_161407), but I've borrowed a lot of structure from [Nikita Voloboev's wiki](https://github.com/nikitavoloboev/knowledge) â€” be sure to check that out too if you'd like to stand up your own.
